# club-bot

Hackathon project for [Grok Bot Community Engineering London Hackathon](https://gb-community-eng-hackathon-10-2026.teamdeel.workers.dev/hackathon), bootstrapped with `hackathon-init`. Brief: [`HACKATHON.md`](HACKATHON.md).

## Working with coding agents

Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and any agent reading [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) share one taskboard: [`agent-coordination/taskboard.md`](agent-coordination/taskboard.md). Each agent registers what it builds, checkpoints as it goes, and can take over a task another agent left unfinished.

Every commit is pushed to GitHub automatically. After cloning, enable once:

```bash
./scripts/agent-taskboard.sh setup
```
