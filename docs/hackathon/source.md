Track 1 · Vetting & moderation

## Gatekeeper

Review applications, keep scammers out, and share a blocklist across groups.

## The problem

Leads read every application by hand and kick bots and scammers one by one. A scammer removed from one group joins the next, because communities share nothing.

## What community leads told us

Every application gets read by hand, often by one tired lead.

Checking a new member means asking "do they fit what we do?", not just "are they real?".

A scammer kicked from one WhatsApp group turns up in the next. There is no shared blocklist.

Chat apps have weak moderation tools, so every removal and warning is manual.

## What to build

An open-source application reviewer. It scores each applicant against the community's own written rules, says accept, ask or decline, and shows why. Store decisions in Supabase.

A shared blocklist that several communities can write to: hashed phone numbers or handles, evidence, who reported it, and an appeal route. Row-level security in Supabase keeps each community's reports private until they're confirmed.

A WhatsApp or Discord moderation bot that flags scam patterns and drafts the removal message. A human presses send.

A review queue for the borderline cases, so a lead clears a week of decisions in ten minutes.

## What a winning demo looks like

An applicant arrives, gets scored and routed with a clear reason. Then a known scammer tries to join a second group and gets stopped.

## Suggested partner stack

Supabase for the shared blocklist and auth, Grok Bot to write the reviewer's reasoning, Cursor to build the bot.

Click a partner for docs and who to find on the night.

## Open-source starters to fork

## Integrations: where community leads live

WhatsApp

Cloud API (official): Free to start. Talks 1:1 with people who message a business number. Outbound needs approved templates; group support is limited.

Baileys · MIT: Unofficial. Logs in as a linked device and can read and post in groups. Against WhatsApp's terms, so use a spare test number.

whatsapp-web.js · Apache-2.0: Unofficial, drives WhatsApp Web. Same caveat as Baileys.

Discord

Discord API (official): Free. Full bot access to the servers that add your bot.

discord.js · Apache-2.0: Node library.

discord.py · MIT: Python library.

## Data community leads offered

Unicorn Mafia: past event data, channel history, member info with consent, and access to their WhatsApp bot. Ask on the night.

AI Agent Lab: will share most data apart from API access. Ask on the night.

## Free data

Sources you can scrape today

SMS spam dataset (Hugging Face) tested 22 Oct

You get: 5,574 labelled messages (sms, label ham/spam). Real scam wording to train or test a chat moderation filter.

Access: No key. Rows API returns up to 100 rows per call.

curl -s 'https://datasets-server.huggingface.co/rows?dataset=ucirvine/sms_spam&config=plain_text&split=train&offset=0&length=100' | jq -r '.rows[].row | [.label, .sms] | @tsv'

GitHub REST API tested 22 Oct

You get: Users/orgs: created_at, public_repos, followers. Repos: stars, topics, language, pushed_at. Search users, repos and orgs by location or topic.

Access: No key: 60 requests/hour, search 10/minute. A free personal token raises it to 5,000/hour.

curl -s 'https://api.github.com/users/octocat' | jq '{created_at, public_repos, followers}'

Devpost project search tested 22 Oct

You get: JSON: name, tagline, url, members (usernames), tags (tech stack), winner, like_count, comment_count. 62k+ results for "community".

Access: No key. Use Accept: application/json.

curl -s -H 'Accept: application/json' 'https://devpost.com/software/search?query=community+bot' | jq -r '.software[] | [.name, .winner, (.tags|join(","))] | @tsv'

All sources and working snippets: Data starter kit.

Never load private member data into a public repo. Collect opt-in applications on the night, or use a lead's data inside the room only. To check whether an applicant's handle belongs to a real builder, use GitHub (account age, repos, followers) and Devpost (past projects).

## How it’s judged

Right accept and decline calls on a test set. Clear reasons. Few real people wrongly blocked. Time saved for a lead.

Every project must be open source (public repo, MIT, Apache-2.0 or AGPL-3.0). All tracks also use the six shared judging criteria below, each scored 1–5.

Track 2 · Members, intros & speakers

## Know Your Members

Find out who your members are, introduce them to each other, and find speakers among them.

## The problem

Most leads know a member as a phone number. Nobody gets introduced, threads die, and finding a good panellist means asking around.

## What community leads told us

One builder group has over a thousand members known only by phone number. Its chat dropped from hundreds of messages a month to a few dozen.

A co-working space wants to know who keeps coming back, why, and what they get out of it.

Organisers want to send every member a few quick questions and actually use the answers.

Finding good panellists and people to demo is slow and depends on who you already know.

## What to build

A short opt-in questionnaire sent over WhatsApp or Discord. Answers go into a member graph in Cognee or Supabase.

An intro bot that suggests one good introduction a week per member, explains why, and still works a month later without the organiser.

A speaker finder: give it a topic and it suggests members and London builders, with proof of what they've built (GitHub, Devpost, Hacker News) or hosted (Luma).

A thread reviver that spots dead conversations worth restarting and drafts the nudge, with a log of what it tried and where it failed.

## What a winning demo looks like

An introduction or revived thread that no organiser made by hand, shown end to end. Then a speaker shortlist for a real topic, each name with evidence.

## Suggested partner stack

Cognee for the member graph, Supabase for answers and consent, Notion as the lead's view, Grok Bot to write the intros.

Click a partner for docs and who to find on the night.

## Open-source starters to fork

Cognee Apache-2.0

Turns answers, chats and profiles into a knowledge graph your agent can query.

sentence-transformers Apache-2.0

Embeddings for matching members by what they build and want.

graphology MIT

Graph library for the member network and connection-density metrics.

mem0 Apache-2.0

Per-member memory for a bot that remembers past conversations.

Luma event JSON (hosts and speakers) free, no key

Each event lists its hosts with LinkedIn, X and website handles. That is a good source of speakers.

## Integrations: where community leads live

Hacker News Algolia API tested 22 Oct

You get: hits[]: title, url, points, num_comments, created_at, author. Filters: tags=story|show_hn, numericFilters=created_at_i>…

Access: No key. Roughly 10,000 requests/hour per IP.

curl -s 'https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search_by_date?query=hackathon&tags=story&hitsPerPage=5' | jq -r '.hits[] | [.created_at, .points, .title] | @tsv'

All sources and working snippets: Data starter kit.

GitHub's API turns an opt-in handle into languages and projects. Devpost project search and Hacker News show what someone has shipped or said.

## How it’s judged

How good the intros and speaker picks are. Evidence for each one. Honesty about failures. Whether a lead would run it every week.

Every project must be open source (public repo, MIT, Apache-2.0 or AGPL-3.0). All tracks also use the six shared judging criteria below, each scored 1–5.

Track 3 · Run sheet, promo & newsletter

## Event Autopilot

Turn one event into a run sheet, posts, visuals and a newsletter that a lead approves with one click.

## The problem

Every week someone writes the event page, makes the visuals, posts everywhere, sends the newsletter and chases volunteers. All by hand.

## What community leads told us

Venues, food, suppliers, pages, money and volunteers all live in different places. Leads want one place to dump it all and have it sorted.

The post and visuals for each event take hours, and AI design tools aren't good enough to ship yet.

Someone writes the newsletter, group messages and social posts every single week.

Volunteers burn out on admin a machine could do. Time saved per volunteer is the number that matters.

## What to build

An event workspace in Notion: drop in notes, quotes and receipts, and it builds the run sheet, budget and volunteer rota.

A promo pipeline: event page copy, on-brand visuals from code templates rather than image models, a Ghost newsletter and posts for WhatsApp, LinkedIn and Discord. The lead approves each one.

A weekly digest that pulls this week's events from Luma and drafts the newsletter and group message.

A helper for the night: check-in, timings and last-minute changes pushed to the group.

## What a winning demo looks like

One event goes from a one-line idea to a run sheet, visuals, a newsletter draft and posts. Show the volunteer hours saved.

## Suggested partner stack

Notion as the workspace, Supabase for event data, Zero to turn Luma guests into follow-ups, Grok Bot for copy, Cursor for templates.

Click a partner for docs and who to find on the night.

Luma single event JSON tested 22 Oct

You get: Full event: description, hosts[] (name, linkedin_handle, twitter_handle, website), sessions, ticket_info, categories, guest_count, calendar. The event id is in the discover feed (api_id).

Access: No key. Same courtesy limits as above.

curl -s 'https://api.lu.ma/event/get?event_api_id=evt-Yz7RR89Zlv56tya' | jq '{name: .event.name, start: .event.start_at, going: .guest_count}'

Luma calendar .ics feed tested 22 Oct

You get: Standard iCalendar: DTSTART, DTEND, SUMMARY, LOCATION, URL per event, past and future. Calendar ids come from calendar_api_id in the discover feed.

curl -s 'https://api.lu.ma/ics/get?entity=calendar&id=cal-wUKLVX9VWOdVkpg' | grep -E '^(DTSTART|SUMMARY)' | head

Eventbrite listing (schema.org JSON-LD) tested 22 Oct

You get: ld+json ItemList of Event: name, description, startDate, endDate, location (venue name, address), url. About 20 per page; add ?page=2.

Access: No key for pages. Official API needs a free OAuth token and only covers your own events.

curl -s -A 'Mozilla/5.0' 'https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/d/united-kingdom--london/tech-events/' | python3 -c "import sys,re,json;[print(i['item']['startDate'],i['item']['name']) for m in re.findall(r'ld\+json\">(.*?)</script>',sys.stdin.read(),re.S) for d in [json.loads(m)] if isinstance(d,dict) and d.get('@type')=='ItemList' for i in d['itemListElement']]"

All sources and working snippets: Data starter kit.

Luma event JSON (api.lu.ma/event/get) and .ics feeds give real event text, dates and venues to test the pipeline on. Make up budgets and rotas.

## How it’s judged

How much of the weekly work really runs itself. Quality of the copy and visuals. Hours saved. Whether a lead would trust it with a real event.

Every project must be open source (public repo, MIT, Apache-2.0 or AGPL-3.0). All tracks also use the six shared judging criteria below, each scored 1–5.

Track 4 · Venues, communities, events

## Open Venue & Events DB

An open database of London venues, communities and events that approved organisers keep up to date together.

## The problem

Finding a free venue for an evening or weekend event is one of the hardest jobs organisers have. The knowledge sits in people's heads. The same goes for which communities exist and which events are worth going to.

## What community leads told us

Finding a venue that will host evening and weekend events for free is the hardest job one organiser told us about.

No one has an up-to-date list of a city's communities: size, audience, what they run and who to contact.

A volunteer adds events to a shared community calendar by hand.

Builders want a ranked list of the best events and hackathons in their city, not filler.

Communities shouldn't compete. Organisers want one shared agent they can all ask.

## What to build

The venue database: capacity, AV, evening and weekend hours, free or paid terms, the contact, and which communities hosted there. Only approved organisers can post, and they vouch for each other. Built on Supabase with PostGIS for "near me" search.

A communities directory in the same database: size, audience, what they run and how to reach the lead, kept fresh from Luma calendars.

An events layer: pull Luma, Devpost, BuilderBase and Meetup into one London calendar, rank events with the reasons shown, and publish an .ics feed other calendars can subscribe to.

Organiser outreach: scrape the hosts of London Luma events (name, LinkedIn, X, website), match them to venues and communities, and draft the intro. Track replies in Zero or Supabase.

A shared agent on top: any approved organiser asks in WhatsApp or Discord "free space for 80 people next Thursday near Old Street?" and gets venues, past hosts and a drafted request. Use Cognee for memory and Grok Bot for the agent.

## What a winning demo looks like

Two organisers add real venues. A third finds one by asking in chat and sends the request. The ranked events feed and .ics calendar update from live data.

## Suggested partner stack

Supabase for the database and PostGIS, Cognee and Grok Bot for the shared agent, Zero for organiser outreach, Notion as a public view.

All sources and working snippets: Data starter kit.

Every source is free with no key: Luma's London discover feed and event JSON (each event lists its hosts with LinkedIn, X and website), Luma .ics calendars, Devpost, BuilderBase, MLH, Meetup and dev.events. Hand-label 30 events to test your ranking. Respect each site's terms and cache what you fetch.

## How it’s judged

Real venues and data entered tonight. A trust model that stops junk. How fast a venue is found. Whether three leads would post their venues tomorrow.

Every project must be open source (public repo, MIT, Apache-2.0 or AGPL-3.0). All tracks also use the six shared judging criteria below, each scored 1–5.

Track 5 · Inbound, pricing, sponsors

## Front Desk & Revenue

Answer inbound in chat, price bookings fairly, and find sponsors.

## The problem

Requests, quotes, pricing and sponsor deals all happen by hand in group chats and DMs. That decides whether events happen at all.

## What community leads told us

A venue wants pricing that works for it and its hosts. Communities book often, bring leads and have no budget. Companies book rarely and pay a lot.

Replies and quotes are manual. Venues want an automatic first reply in chat.

Requests arrive in a full WhatsApp group and get lost. Leads need them turned into a ranked task list, and want to know when the bot fails instead of it dying silently.

Sponsors live in people's heads and spreadsheets. Communities want a simple sponsor CRM.

## What to build

A pricing engine trained on a venue's real booking history. It quotes each request and explains community versus company pricing.

An inbound bot that replies in WhatsApp, qualifies the request, then books a call or sends the quote.

A front desk that turns every chat message into a task with an owner and a priority, and logs what it couldn't handle.

A sponsor CRM: scrape Luma event hosts and Devpost hackathon organisers to see who already backs London events, size them with Companies House, and draft the email. Run it in Zero or Twenty.

## What a winning demo looks like

A chat request comes in, gets qualified, priced from past bookings and quoted. Then it's matched to a likely sponsor with a drafted email.

## Suggested partner stack

Zero for sponsor and organiser pipeline (it syncs Luma guests), Supabase for bookings, Grok Bot for replies, Cursor for the pricing model.

## Integrations: where community leads live

WhatsApp

Cloud API (official): Free to start. Talks 1:1 with people who message a business number. Outbound needs approved templates; group support is limited.

Baileys · MIT: Unofficial. Logs in as a linked device and can read and post in groups. Against WhatsApp's terms, so use a spare test number.

whatsapp-web.js · Apache-2.0: Unofficial, drives WhatsApp Web. Same caveat as Baileys.

Slack

Bolt for JavaScript · MIT: Official framework for Slack apps. Free workspaces work.

LinkedIn

Share on LinkedIn (official): Self-serve, but only posts as the signed-in member. Reading other people, groups or company pages needs partner approval you won't get tonight. Scraping is against their terms. Use a lead's own data export or manual paste.

Luma

Luma API (official): Needs Luma Plus (paid) and covers your own calendar. Public pages and the discover feed are in the Data starter kit.

Zero Luma sync: Zero pulls Luma guests into its pipeline, so attendees become contacts you can enrich and follow up.

## Data community leads offered

Night Office: a redacted history of their events and what was paid, to train and test pricing. Ask on the night.

## Free data

Sources you can scrape today

Luma single event JSON tested 22 Oct

You get: Full event: description, hosts[] (name, linkedin_handle, twitter_handle, website), sessions, ticket_info, categories, guest_count, calendar. The event id is in the discover feed (api_id).

Access: No key. Same courtesy limits as above.

curl -s 'https://api.lu.ma/event/get?event_api_id=evt-Yz7RR89Zlv56tya' | jq '{name: .event.name, start: .event.start_at, going: .guest_count}'

Devpost hackathons API tested 22 Oct

You get: title, url, submission_period_dates, displayed_location, themes, prize_amount (HTML), registrations_count, organization_name. 9 per page; meta.total_count. Filters: status[]=upcoming|open|ended, search=london.

Access: No key. Send a browser User-Agent; plain bots get 403 on hackathon subdomains.

curl -s -g 'https://devpost.com/api/hackathons?status[]=ended&search=london' | jq -r '.hackathons[] | [.title, .submission_period_dates, .registrations_count, .organization_name] | @tsv'

Companies House (UK company data) tested 22 Oct

You get: Company number, status, SIC codes (industry), incorporation date, registered address, filing history and accounts. Good for sizing a sponsor.

Access: Free API key from developer.company-information.service.gov.uk (basic auth, key as username). 600 requests per 5 minutes. No key at all: the HTML search at find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk, or the free monthly bulk company data product.

curl -s -A 'Mozilla/5.0' 'https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/search/companies?q=cloudflare' | grep -o 'href="/company/[0-9A-Z]*"' | head -3 # with a key: curl -u "$CH_KEY:" https://api.company-information.service.gov.uk/search/companies?q=cloudflare

BuilderBase public discovery API tested 22 Oct

You get: data.events[]: name, slug, start_at, end_at, format, event_type, location (city, country, lat, lng), participant_count, track_count, organization.name, theme_tags; data.next_cursor.

Access: No key for discovery. The full API (registrations, submissions, judging) needs a key: developers.builderbase.com.

curl -s 'https://edge.builderbase.com/super-events/public/discovery?status=active&limit=100' | jq -r '.data.events[] | [.start_at, .name, .location.city, .participant_count] | @tsv'

All sources and working snippets: Data starter kit.

Companies House (free key, or the no-key search page) sizes a UK sponsor. Devpost's hackathon API shows organisers and prize pools. Luma event JSON names the hosts of every London event.

## How it’s judged

Prices that make sense on held-out bookings and are explained. Fast, correct replies. Sponsor matches that fit. Whether a venue would use it for real.

Every project must be open source (public repo, MIT, Apache-2.0 or AGPL-3.0). All tracks also use the six shared judging criteria below, each scored 1–5.

Wildcard · Your own community idea

## Weird Stuff

You already run or know a community and have an idea that doesn't fit the other tracks. Build that.

## The problem

Some of the best tools come from people fixing their own community's problem. If yours doesn't fit a track, bring it here.

## What community leads told us

Tell the judges which community it's for and what hurts today.

Show it working on real data or with a real lead in the room.

## What to build

Anything that solves a real problem for a real community, built in the open.

Start from the Data starter kit and the integrations below if you need data or a channel.

## What a winning demo looks like

Name the community, show the problem, and show your build fixing it live.

## Suggested partner stack

Pick from Supabase, Cognee, Zero, Notion, Grok Bot and Cursor.

Click a partner for docs and who to find on the night.

## Open-source starters to fork

Grok Bot skill MIT

Point Grok Bot at your repo and community context.

Cognee Apache-2.0

Memory layer for any community agent.

Supabase Apache-2.0

## Demo Format & Criteria



## Demo format

Work solo or in teams of up to 5.

Every team submits a working demo at code freeze (21:50).

The Top 5 teams present live, 3 minutes each.

From those finalists, judges award 1st, 2nd and 3rd place.

## Judging criteria

Technical execution

Is it open source, and could another community run it next week?

Use of community context

Better than what leads use today

Real-world usefulness

Demo quality

Open source is required: a public GitHub repo with an MIT, Apache-2.0 or AGPL-3.0 licence file.
